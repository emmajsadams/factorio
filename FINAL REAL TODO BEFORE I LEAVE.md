FINAL REAL TODO BEFORE I LEAVE

- Put a bunch of valuable resources that I cannot ship
- Move all production to moon. Basically only do things on surface that need tons of water, are physically not allowed to be in space, or cannot be easily shot via delivery cannon.
- - use helmmod to actually create factory line productions and avoid the heavy use of drones

- Setup delivery cannon chests at all the outposts so that I can resupply from the moon
- Consider changing oil fields and uranium mines to deliver their goods via delivery cannon. Basically I would just need to resupply those via train with delivery cannon capsules.
